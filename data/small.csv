A3UPFTGAWZ3G2R,David J. Loftus,"Jenkins, a history professor and Member of Parliament himself as well as the author of an acclaimed bio of Gladstone, presents a fine biography of Britain's greatest 20th century figure.His own experiences uniquely qualify him to describe Churchill's political fortunes and maneuverings, although the American reader may find the Teens and Twenties either slow going or not sufficiently illuminating of Britain's odd political system, wherein politicians regularly shopped around for a district to represent, even after being defeated in another.This is a fairly traditional public and political bio, not a psychoanalysis (not to imply that Churchill HAD much of a personal life to expose), and moves along at a surprisingly good clip despite its 900-plus pages.Jenkins fully reminds us that Churchill basically earned his living as a writer -- the contracts, writing schedules, and royalties are carefully recorded -- though politics was his avocation.The author writes cleanly and engagingly, though he seems inordinately fond of unnecessarily unusual words like &quot;psephological&quot; and &quot;rumbustious.&quot; On the other hand, his wit is dry and regularly in evidence.The U.S. hardcover edition by Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux is clean until about the halfway point, whereupon one begins to encounter &quot;Feburary&quot; (436), &quot;replies hardly every being allowed&quot; (553) &quot;shore up the the&quot; (706), &quot;dimayed&quot; (721), &quot;The opposition could chose when to relax&quot; (837-8), and similar infelicities.All in all, Jenkins seems to strike a nice balance between a healthy respect for his subject and a clear eye for Churchill's weaknesses, changes of direction, and occasional seizures of dishonesty.Well illustrated with more than 90 b&amp;w photos.",4,"Quite readable, nicely done","12 6, 2001",40,37,4

AEAF4MRYHJZI,"Angelia Menchan ""acvermen.blogspot.com""","Fierce Angels by Sheri Park reads like a dissertation on how African-American women are viewed in America. From page one I was caught up in how Dr. Parks broke down our images, whether it is the way we are portrayed by the media or within our own communities. Her writing, though very didactic, is still so readable and relatable for any African-American woman who has lived in America. She refers to the black woman's heritage as The Sacred Dark Feminine and in her words she leaves no stone unturned. There is much mention made of the stereotype of `mammy' type black woman and also the black woman as being sexually voracious. It is clear that the author conducted many interviews and a great deal of research to bring this book to fruition. I particularly loved how  she clearly stated that the `Strong Black Woman' is idealized and that no human can sustain such a reputation without much cost to her psyche.My favorite chapter in the book was entitled, ""You say `Angry Black Woman' Like It Is A Bad Thing."" Dr. Parks made clear that women like First Lady Michelle Obama are by no means angry, just honest and normal. However, she breaks down how the sister who drags her `baby-daddy' to court and who robs `Peter to pay Paul' is angry and justifiably so. I read that chapter twice.I recommend Fierce Angels: The Strong Black Woman in American Life and Culture to all African-American women over the age of 16 and the people who love and want to know them better.This book was provided by the publisher for review purposes.Angelia MenchanAPOOO BookClub",4,So FIERCE,"03 24, 2010",9,9,4
A3B7KU72LGWFER,"Grifel ""Tea Time""","Clearly this author had two goals in mind: 1) to take advantage of the Americans-living-in-Europe publishing trend, a la Frances Mayes, and 2) to brag endlessly!  I tired of reading about the author's expensive apartment and furniture, his Mercedes and his impressive friends after a few chapters and gave up on this.  Too bad the author doesn't have the skill to write what the cover promised: an entertaining tale of a family living in Rome! Also too bad Amazon only put the 5 star reviews on the first screen -- I could have saved some money if I'd read all the reviews shown here!",1,Drivel!,"06 21, 2003",19,13,1
A3JD07VHDLT5FF,"isala ""Isabel and Lars""","This is a collection of stories and memories by Japanese soldiers that fought in Burma between 1942 and 1945. The collection does not intend to give a comprehensive picture of the war, or of its participants. It is a series of snapshots of war as seen by the eyes of the ordinary people that actually fight it. Neither does the collection have literary ambitions: they have just told us their stories dircetly as they experienced them, with no special narrative technique or refinement. It actually does make the book so much more powerful.Some people have complained that it is mainly about marching or waiting, well: that's what war is for ordinary soldiers: No maps, no situation reports, no overview, no moral justification. They walk in the direction they are told, the lie down when bullets start buzzing around their ears, and they try and kill the enemy before he kills them. In between actions they try and puzzle together a life away from fear.Maybe we are spoilt by the magnificent war memoirs by some of the German generals, which, on the other hand, were educated cultured men with a bird's view of the war.There are some especially poignant stories about meetings between British and Japanese soldiers which are far away from the Hollywood image of the raving yellow lunatics that must be killed on sight.These men and women were not so much different from the allied soldiers we are taught to revere. And, indeed, they were often hailed as liberators by the colonial subjects of the US, Britain, France, and Holland.",5,Compelling stories by ordinary people,"03 19, 2005",7,5,5
A1JBVAMC9YU0WD,ED,"I am so glad I borrowed this 'book' from the library instead of parting with my hard-earned cash. However, the eight - ten hours I spent reading it are 8 hours of my life that I'm never going to get back. The sooner the public gets wise to self-help claptrap like this (some self-help books are well written and helpful - not this one), then the sooner it can stop lining the pockets of jokers like Spencer Johnson.",1,this 'cheese' stinks,"09 25, 2000",6,5,1

A1RAUVCWYHTQI4,A. Ross,"I don't read a lot of science-fiction (maybe five or so novels a year), but when I do, I tend to prefer works set in the relatively near-future, where the action mainly takes place on Earth. Having spent six weeks in Thailand a few years ago, this much-ballyhooed work set in Bangkok caught my attention and I thought I'd give it a whirl. The story takes place after ""the Contraction"", an era of global economic and ecological meltdown following the end of the petroleum-based economic system we currently are immersed in. In addition to rising sea levels (presumably due to global warming) which threaten to flood Bangkok, various killer viruses have spread across the global food supply chain, leaving giant GMO-based agribusinesses with virus-resistant grain product lines in positions of huge power. It's no longer Washington's shadow that falls heavily across the world, it's Des Moines'!The main characters include Anderson (an industrial spy for an American agribusiness) Hock Seng (the manager  of Anderson's front kinkspring manufacturing factory and a Chinese refugee from ethnic cleansing in Malaysia), Jaidee (a zealous and incorruptible Thai officer in the Ministry of Environment's enforcement army), and Emiko (the titular Japanese ""windup girl"" -- a genetically customized ""new person"" who is kept as a sex slave). The main thrust of the story is a contest for power between the Thai Ministry of the Environment, who is tasked with keeping the kingdom free of biological viruses, and the Thai Ministry of Trade, who naturally seeks to promote trade. The goals of the two ministries are at odds with each other, and the whole book is a long buildup to an inevitable showdown (and by extension, a rather transparent critique of capitalism).Amidst this brewing conflict, Anderson is trying to scheme his way into getting access to the Thai kingdom's ultra-secure seed bank. Hock Seng is trying to scheme his way into long-term financial and personal security by stealing potentially breakthrough technology from the factory he managers. Jaidee is trying to live up to the oath he swore to protect the kingdom. And Emiko is trying to find a way out of her perpetual abuse. The psychology, backstories, and motivations of these, and all the other characters, is rich and convincing. Similarly, many of the details of the post-Contraction Bangkok are quite vivid and well-done, and it's easy to get immersed in the city (although some aspects doesn't make a ton of sense, like the lack of wind or solar energy). There's a strong element of the thriller that runs throughout it, along with some pretty good action sequences (and several exceedingly graphic scenes of sexual debasement and rape that are not for the faint of heart, but are very relevant to the plot).And yet, despite all these positives, the book never really engaged me that much. It has a certain pacing problem that I can't quite put my finger on, but it often felt like it was taking too long to advance the story. The real kicker is that near the very end it starts to become very obvious that this is just the first installment of a series. That's particularly annoying because it would have been possible to end it in a way that would make it a satisfying stand-alone book, but there's more stuff tacked on as kind of a tease. I wish science-fiction and fantasy writers could take a page from mystery writers and learn how to write series where individual books can stand alone and not feel like incomplete segments of a trilogy.",3,Lots of Good Elements Fail to Add Up to an Engaging Read,"08 4, 2010",3,2,3
